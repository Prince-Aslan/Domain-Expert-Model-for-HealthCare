## Domain Expert Model for Health Care Using the Meta Llama 2 7B model in AWS

This project was carried out in completion of the AWS Generative AI course in Udacity.

While 3 dataset were given (financial dataset, IT dataset and medical dataset), I chose the medical dataset for this project. However, all datasets have been added here in the repo for anyone who would love to get their hands dirty. lol

In the model evaluation notebook, I deployed the Meta Llama 2 7B model and evaluate its text generation capabilities and domain knowledge. I used the SageMaker Python SDK for Foundation Models and deployed the model for inference.

In the model fine tuning notebook I fine-tuned the Meta Llama 2 7B large language model, deployed the fine-tuned model, and tested its text generation and domain knowledge capabilities.

Enjoy
